# Simple Bank Management System in Python
A very simple bank management system in Python that I decided to do while I was bored, you can use it for whatever you want.

## Features
The features and functionality of this program isn't really complex or over the top, it has simple and easy to understand features such as  

***Account Creation:*** Create a new account in the system.  

***Login:*** Utilizes the data gathered from the account creation process to login, or you can just use _existing_username_ and _existing_password_ if you're too lazy going through the account creation process. 
   
***Basic bank functionalities:*** This program lets you deposit money to your balance, withdraw money and checking balance whilst analyzing and saving every input.
